# Eatlocal

Eatlocal, for food lovers and curious travelers.  
An App to find a host to taste authentic local food.  
Final project of Ironhack web development bootcamp (April 2019).  
Stack: MERN.

You can find a first working version at: https://eatlocal.herokuapp.com/  
We implemented it "mobile first", so change for iphone 5/SE view to have the better experience.  
In this first working version you can search only for:
